prompt = """For the following rules, make plans that can fetch the required data to validate the rules. For each plan, indicate \
which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a \
variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...)

Tools can be one of the following:
(1) Notes[input]: Worker that searches for patient visit notes. Useful when you need to confirm a diagnosis or treatment.
(2) LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general
world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem
yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For example,
Task: Thomas Jones is being prescribed the medication {drug}
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve
with Wolfram Alpha. #E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x − 10) + ((2x − 10) − 8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked. #E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked. #E3 = Calculator[(2 ∗ #E2 − 10) − 8]

Begin! 
Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan should be followed by only one #E.

Task: {task}"""
